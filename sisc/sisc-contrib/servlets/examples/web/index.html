    <h1>SISC Web Application Examples</h1>

    <a href="calculator">a really, really simple calculator</a>. After
    entering the number of operands you are prompted to enter each
    operand in turn. The sum of the operands is displayed at the end.
    <p>
      The source for the calculator is <a
      href="scheme/calculator.scm">here</a>. You will notice that the
      core algorithm is completely independent of the means and timing
      of the input and output operations, i.e. the same Scheme code
      could be used to add numbers read from a file or returned from a
      number generator procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The calculator also shows off the <i>maintaining state in
        continuations</i> approach - pressing the "back" and "forward"
      buttons in your browser or cloning the page does the right
      thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, if you are running this example in a J2EE application
      server that persists sessions, you can see that the calculator
      sessions are persistent. For instance, in Tomcat 4.x you can
      shut down the application server in the middle of entering the
      sequence of operands. When you restart the application server
      you can continue entering the operands where you left off.
