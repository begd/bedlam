This is a fork of the excellent SISCWeb Web Framework by Alessandro Colomba.
Original Website: http://siscweb.sourceforge.net/overview.html
This is specifically developed to be used as part of and together with bedlam:
 - http://github.com/igorhvr/bedlam/
There are only a few changes, really. Unless you have some reason to do
otherwise (e.g.: you use SISCWeb with PostgreSQL - there are a few changes that
are useful with it that I was not yet able to get in upstream) I recommend you stick
to the official distribution.

The siscweb-history-before-merging-repositories tag has the full history / all
commits before I decided to merge the siscweb repository inside the full bedlam
repository.
