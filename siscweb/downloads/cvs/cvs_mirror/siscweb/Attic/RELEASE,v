v0.1

I would like to announce the first public release of SISCweb available
from http://www.sf.net/projects/siscweb/.

SISCweb is a framework implemented in SISC and Java to allow writing
Scheme web applications in a J2EE environment. Through the use of
first-class continuations, sxml and a server-side REPL, SISCweb aims
to make web development fun again.

SISCweb is based on SISC (sisc.sf.net), a Scheme interpreter for the
JVM, and is heavily influenced by other Lisp web frameworks:

  - the PLT web server collection
    (http://download.plt-scheme.org/scheme/docs/html/web-server/)
  - SUnet (http://www.scsh.net/resources/sunet.html)
  - AllegroServe (http://allegroserve.sourceforge.net/)

A couple of design decisions were also lifted from Matthias
Radestock's servlet code in the contrib section of the SISC CVS tree.


OBJECTIVES

SISCweb aims to provide:

  - An interactive, REPL-based web application development style:
    developers should be able to write applications interactively,
    without ever bouncing the server and (insofar as it is desirable)
    ever losing application state. [*]
  - Continuation-based execution control flow: developers should not
    need to shuffle state back and forth the request/session objects
    and language-level variables.
  - A concise set of functions to build content (HTML, FO, images...):
    developers should be able to describe the presentation in a language
    appropriate to the application, and have transformation operators
    generate the content.
  - A robust continuation management engine: by v1.0 an application
    written in SISCweb should be as resilient to load as a traditional
    Java web application.
  - The inherent abstraction power of Scheme and the industry support
    of Java.

[*] Save for the Java portion and the "bootstrap" Scheme code, SISCweb
    itself has been written in a REPL running in the web server, with
    hardly any server bounces.


STATUS

While about as featureful as PLT's web-server collection, this release
is strictly oriented to the code-divers. Documentation is basically
inexistent, but a few illustrative examples are included to showcase
the main features.
