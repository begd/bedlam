      <title>State in Traditional Web Applications</title>

      <para>
        Introductions to web programming often mention the
        statelessness of the HTTP protocol, to then describe how cookies
        and sessions solve the problem. This is not a complete solution
        however: being &quot;sessionful&quot; is not the same as being
        &quot;stateful.&quot;
      </para>

      <para>
        Cookies and sessions are mechanisms laid on top of the HTTP
        protocol respectively to: a) allow an application to recognize
        two requests coming from the same browser as such, and b) to
        store data common to such requests.
      </para>

      <para>
        Neither cookies nor sessions completely address the issue of
        statelesness because, while programs have the means to
        associate two requests to a given user (as they contain the
        same cookie), they have no means by which to associate two
        requests as being part of the same navigation flow. It is in
        fact possible to manually place requests out of sync with
        program state, and often trigger incorrect
        behavior. Traditional web applications are thus less like a
        program with a GUI interface and more like an API open to the
        world. Forced browsing, or even using the back button, can
        cause an application to misbehave in ways that are not easily
        foreseeable as application complexity increases.
      </para>

      <para>
        Aside from state, the Session object is common to all requests
        from the same browser, so simply using a web application from
        two windows can produce concurrency problems such as loss of
        consistency or race conditions. Moreover, since the session is
        a global scope for the application, in fact the only scope
        that traditionally persists from request to request,
        developers are unable to take advantage of the finer scoping
        mechanisms available in modern programming languages.
      </para>

      <para>
        One last major issue with traditional web applications is that
        they are made of short-lived code snippets which, after
        parsing the request in the context of the session, generate a
        response and exit. Because their state is lost, it is
        impossible to use structured programming techniques in code
        spanning multiple requests. Even the simplest for-loop must be
        expressed in terms of a (global) session variable increment
        and a GOTO (HREF).
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="state-continuation">
      <title>Continuations and State</title>

      <para>
        Continuations afford a truly stateful approach. When a program
        generates a response, it suspends its execution instead of
        exiting. This suspended state is a continuation, and it
        includes stack and variables in scope.  When the execution is
        resumed by the subsequent request, stack and variables are as
        they were left -- no manual storage in the session is
        needed.
      </para>

      <para>
        &SISCweb;, like other similar frameworks, is able to determine
        which requests are associated with which continuations by
        branding each request and its corresponding continuation with
        a unique, cryptographically strong hash.
      </para>

      <para>
        Branding reduces the issue of the back button because any
        request originating from a page in the browser history is
        associated with a unique continuation. Re-submitting the same
        request results in the same code being run, with the same
        local variables and stack it had at the time it was
        suspended. A program written in functional style (i.e. with no
        side effects) will be completely immune to the back button.
      </para>

      <para>
        Saving the local state means that a for-loop can be written at
        the language level. (The <ulink
        url="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/siscweb/siscweb/examples/scm/examples/hello-world.scm?view=markup">Polyglot
        Hello World</ulink> example included with &SISCweb;
        demonstrates this feature.)  Saving the stack also means that
        an entire navigation flow can be represented as a subroutine
        returning a value, rather than as a sequence of code snippets
        connected by GOTOs (HREFs) finally depositing a value in the
        global scope.
      </para>
    </section>

    <section id="state-finer">
      <title>Finer Statefulness</title>

      <para>
        Most complex applications will require a finer amount of
        control over state. For instance, a shopping cart should
        reflect the most recent operations even if the user were to
        backtrack by a few pages and resume shopping from a point in
        the navigation history. SRFI-39 or plain session variables can
        be used in such cases.
      </para>

      <para>
        In other cases state is more closely dependent to the specific
        page, such as in the case of sorting a table in the
        browser. The sorting order should behave consistently in the
        presence of backtracking, cloning, and concurrent requests.
      </para>

      <para>
        A possible solution for these cases is state-passing style,
        where a structure is passed from continuation to continuation
        and updated non-destructively. This can be somewhat
        inconvenient though, so instead &SISCweb; implements Web
        Cells, a dynamic scoping mechanism that follows the page flow
        and branches with backtracking and cloning.

      A complete treatment of parameters is available in <ulink
      url="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-39/">SRFI-39</ulink>. This
      section is concerned with the use of the dynamic environment to
      maintain state shared by all requests for the same user in the
      same execution flow.
    </para>

    <para>
      SRFI-39 parameters are essentially dynamically-scoped
      variables. They can be defined in the global or the module scope
      and then bound to the dynamic scope -- the scope of the
      execution flow -- in the application entry point through the
      <function>parameterize</function> form.
    </para>

    <para>
      When using <function>send-*/[suspend|forward]</function>, the
      parameters, being part of the dynamic environment, are captured
      in the suspended state -- the suspension of the program
      execution is transparent to parameter bindings.
    </para>

    <para>
      However procedures stored with
      <function>@href-p</function>-style attributes or the
      <function>forward/store!</function> procedure will run in the
      base dynamic environment, and thus will see fresh values of the
      parameters. In those cases on can use
      <function>forward/dynenv/store!</function>, which instead
      preserves the dynamic environment.

      Web Cells are a way to track program state according to the
      navigation flow. They are described in full in the paper <ulink
      url="http://library.readscheme.org/servlets/cite.ss?pattern=McCarthySK-Scheme2006">Interaction-Safe
      State for the Web</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      In essence, cells establish a dynamic scope over the navigation
      path of a user. Successive pages can overshadow values of
      bindings set in previous pages, but do not destroy them.
    </para>

    <para>
      If a user backtracks the browser window, previous values are
      again visible. If the user clones the window and proceeds
      through two different navigation branches, each branch sees the
      values it overshadows.

            sessions be serialized across context or server restarts,
            it may be important to guarantee that cells defined in the
            toplevel or int the module scope carry the same name.
