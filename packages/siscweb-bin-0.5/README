SISCWEB

OVERVIEW

SISCweb is a framework aimed to facilitate writing stateful Scheme web
applications in J2EE environments.


FEATURES

SISCweb sports an interactive, REPL-based web application development
style. Developers can write applications interactively, without ever
restarting the context, and, insofar as it is desirable, without ever
losing application state. (In fact, save for the Java portion, SISCweb
itself is developed interactively in its own REPL.)

Through the use of continuations, SISCweb does away with the
page-centric execution model typical of web applications [*].  Every
time a response is sent to the browser, the program execution flow is
suspended, to be then resumed from that exact point when the browser
submits a request.

Queinnec. "Inverting back the inversion of control or, continuations
versus page-centric programming". Technical Report 7, LIP6. May
2001. (http://www-spi.lip6.fr/~queinnec/Papers/www.ps.gz)


REQUIREMENTS

SISCweb requires a J2EE 1.3 application server and a JDK 1.4 or
later. More detailed information is contained in the documentation.


CREDITS

SISCweb is based on SISC (sisc.sf.net), a Scheme interpreter for the
JVM, and is heavily influenced by other Lisp web frameworks:

  - the PLT web server collection
    (http://download.plt-scheme.org/scheme/docs/html/web-server/)
  - SUnet (http://www.scsh.net/resources/sunet.html)
  - AllegroServe (http://allegroserve.sourceforge.net/)

A couple of initial design decisions were also lifted from Matthias
Radestock's servlet code in the contrib section of the SISC CVS tree.
