slib-3b2 news:

 From Clemens Fischer

  * html4each.scm (htm-fields): Value always is string.

 From Sarah Jaffer

  * prec.scm: Rewrote to make thread-safe; fluid-let variables
  replaced with `dyn' argument to most procedures.

 From Andrea Girotto

  * kawa.init (scheme-implementation-version): Update for Kawa-1.9.3.

 From Adam Sampson

  * Makefile (install): Fixed DESTDIR use.

 From Aubrey Jaffer

  * prec.scm (prec:parse): Removed input newline flushing.
  Added initial-column argument.

  * require.scm (report:print): Report locations if given filename
  argument.

  * html4each.scm (htm-fields): Treat DTDs like comments.  Fixed
  handling of closing tags.  Corrected documentation.

  * qp.scm (qp): Don't add newlines when *qp-width* is #f.
  * trace.scm (debug:trace-procedure): Increased indent increment to
  2; wrap at column 31 so that depths 16 to 31 are offset.

  * dynamic.scm (dynamic-environment-rtd, dynamic-rtd):
  * priorque.scm (make-heap):
  * queue.scm (make-queue):
  * synclo.scm (make-reserved-name-item):
  * values.scm (values): In SISC (1.16.6), the second argument to
  'record-constructor' is not optional.  Second arguments added.
  * sisc.init (syncase:eval, syncase:load): Added.

  * mitscheme.init(system): Now called run-shell-command.
  (print-call-stack): Added dummy definition for trace.

  * guile.init (list->array): Redefine to take 3 arguments.
  (vector->array, array->vector): Define if missing.
  (implementation-vicinity): Thomas Bushnell points out
  that %site-dir mashes all slibcat for all versions together.
  %library-dir (since Guile-1.6) is the versioned directory.
  (library-vicinity): Last resort changed to "/usr/share/slib/".

  * slib.texi (Catalog Creation): Added mention of implcat.
  (Compiled and Implementation-Specific Features): Added section.
  (System Interface): The procedure `system' is Posix.
  (Input/Output): Fixed typo in file-position.
