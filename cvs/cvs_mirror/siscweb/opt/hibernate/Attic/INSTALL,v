@REQUIREMENTS

The SISCweb Hibernate add-on requires an active internet connection so that
dependent libraries may be downloaded from the Maven 2 repository.


COMPILING

Before compiling, the root project (SISCweb) must have been compiled
and packed. That can be accomplished by running "ant dist" in the
project root.

That done, "ant dist" in the opt/hibernate/ folder will compile and
pack the addon, and will also copy its jar (siscweb-hibernate.jar) and
all dependent libraries (hibernate.jar, etc.) to the project root in
the dist/opt/hibernate/ folder.


INSTALLING

The Hibernate add-on can typically be used by simply copying the
libraries in dist/opt/hibernate to a web application's WEB-INF/lib/
folder.

The SISCweb examples can be made to use the Hibernate add-on simply by:


1. modifying the WEB-INF/web.xml and WEB-INF/scm/init.scm files
as per the directions in there contained, and
2. building it normally (ant dist-examples) after having followed the
instructions in the COMPILING section above.

By default the Hibernate add-on uses a memory-based HSQLDB instance. The database can be specified
in the src/hibernate.cfg.xml file.
