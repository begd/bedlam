@; -- Function: find-string-from-port? STR IN-PORT MAX-NO-CHARS
;    Looks for a string STR within the first MAX-NO-CHARS chars of the
;    input port IN-PORT
;    MAX-NO-CHARS may be omitted: in that case, the search span would be
;    limited only by the end of the input stream.
;    When the STR is found, the function returns the number of
;    characters it has read from the port, and the port is set
;    to read the first char after that (that is, after the STR)
;    The function returns #f when the string wasn't found
; Note the function reads the port *STRICTLY* sequentially, and does not
; perform any buffering. So the function can be used even if the port is open
; on a pipe or other communication channel.
;
; Probably can be classified as misc-io.
;
; Notes on the algorithm.
; A special care should be taken in a situation when one had achieved a partial
; match with (a head of) STR, and then some unexpected character appeared in
; the stream. It'll be rash to discard all already read characters. Consider
; an example of string "acab" and the stream "bacacab...", specifically when
;    a  c  a _b_
; b  a  c  a  c  a  b ...
; that is, when 'aca' had matched, but then 'c' showed up in the stream
; while we were looking for 'b'. In that case, discarding all already read
; characters and starting the matching process from scratch, that is,
; from 'c a b ...', would miss a certain match.
; Note, we don't actually need to keep already read characters, or at least
; strlen(str) characters in some kind of buffer. If there has been no match,
; we can safely discard read characters. If there was some partial match,
; we already know the characters before, they are in the STR itself, so
; we don't need a special buffer for that.
